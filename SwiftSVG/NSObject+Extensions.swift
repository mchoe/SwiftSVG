//
//  This file is from a dynamic framework I created called Breakfast. I included the
//  files here so you didn't have to install another Cocoapod to use and test out
//  this library. As such, this file may not be maintained as well, so use it at
//  your own risk.
//
//  SwiftSVG is one of the many great tools that are a part of Breakfast. If you're
//  looking for a great start to your next Swift project, check out Breakfast.
//  It contains classes and helper functions that will get you started off right.
